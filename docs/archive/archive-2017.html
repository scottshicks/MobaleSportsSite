                    <p class="lead">MAINE ORGANIZATION for BLIND ATHLETIC and LEADERSHIP EDUCATION</p>
                    <p><strong>VOL 1 No. 3 - October, 2017, www.mobale.org</strong></p>

                    <h3>SUMMER Sports Education CAMP 2017 - SPORTS EXTRAVAGANZA!</h3>

                    <p>On June 21, MOBALE welcomed 10 athletes from Maine and New Hampshire to the 2017 Summer Sports Educational Camp (SEC) in Waterville, Maine. They met on Wednesday afternoon at a new venue for accommodations at the townhouses of Thomas College. If you think camp is a "walk in the park", think again! Here is a sample of a day in the life of a MOBALE athlete…</p>

                    <p><strong>Daily Schedule:</strong> 6:45-Wake up; 7:30-board the bus to Alfond Center for breakfast; 8:00-running, long jump and shot put; 10:30-goalball; 12:00-lunch; 1:00-gymnastics, swimming, & rock climbing; 4:00-Wrestling; 6:00-Dinner; 7:30-Bowling; 9:00-Athlete meeting; 9:30-shower; 10:00-lights out and rest up for the next jam-packed day of sporting experiences!</p>

                    <p>To that varied list of sports, add archery, martial arts, Zumba and beep baseball and bumpy bus rides where athletes socialize and forge friendships that many will never forget.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday, the fun of learning new sports culminated with individual and team competitions, a banquet lunch, and awards. CONGRATULATIONS to this year's recipients: <strong>Athlete of the Year, Kamdyn McCallister</strong> and <strong>Spirit Award, Courtney Skillin</strong> for their skill, perseverance and helpfulness to both athletes and staff.</p>

                    <h4>SPOTLIGHT ON SPECIAL AWARDS</h4>
                    <p>The "Organization of the Year" was awarded to <strong>John T. Cyr and Sons Bus Lines of Old Towne</strong> for its generous donation of a school bus used to transport athletes among multiple venues. Augusta School District driver, Rolfe Frost, cheerfully commandeered the vehicle of energetic athletes and volunteers from early morning til late at night for many miles during the SEC. In 2012, Cyr & Sons celebrated its founding 100 years ago and continues to provide outstanding service to Maine communities.</p>

                    <p>The "Volunteer of the Year" award recognizes an individual who has made outstanding contributions to MOBALE through their dedication, expertise, and positive impact on our athletes. This year's award recipient demonstrated exceptional commitment to supporting visually impaired youth in their athletic endeavors.</p>

                    <h4>THANK YOU</h4>
                    <p>A huge thanks to all volunteers, staff, and supporters who made the 2017 Summer Sports Education Camp a tremendous success. Your dedication to providing opportunities for blind and visually impaired youth continues to make a lasting impact on the lives of our athletes.</p>

                    <h3>WINTER SPORTS CAMP 2017</h3>

                    <p>On February 12-15, Sugarloaf Mountain Resort played host to five MOBALE athletes with visual impairments at the annual Winter Sports Education Camp. With a big storm forecast, several athletes were unable to make the trip, but those who did, participated in a flurry of snowy sports including alpine and Nordic skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing and ice skating. Athletic days were followed by evenings at the fireside getting to know each other, laughing together and learning about maintaining a healthy lifestyle through eating right and exercise. Guest speaker, Randy Pierce, an accomplished mountain climber from New Hampshire, founder of 20/20 Vision Quest, inspired athletes and volunteers with his message of not letting a disability be an obstacle to living a full and active life.</p>

                    <p><strong>CONGRATULATIONS</strong> to the four MOBALE athletes who placed 1, 3, 4, and 6 in the ladies division of the NEVI ski fest (New England Visually Impaired) downhill ski competition. We also had one medalist in snowshoeing.</p>

                    <h4>APPRECIATION</h4>
                    <p>Thanks to the MOBALE board and volunteers, both up-front and behind the scenes, who made this camp possible. Also to Sugarloaf staff, the Adaptive Outdoor Education Center, Maine DBVI, and POLAND SPRINGS for its generous donation and… to Mother Nature for the SNOW!</p>

                    <h3>ANNUAL MEETING AND ELECTIONS</h3>
                    <p>MOBALE elected a new board of directors in February.
