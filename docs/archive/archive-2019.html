                        <h4>WINTER SPORTS EDUCATION CAMP - "SNOW" MUCH FUN FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED ATHLETES</h4>
                        <p>2019 brought northern New England record amounts of the white stuff and MOBALE blind and visually impaired youth athletes took advantage of it! The Winter Sports Education Camp (WSEC) was held February 10-13 at Sugarloaf Mountain in Carrabasset Valley, Maine. Four athletes and one counselor-in-training attended and participated in the sports of skiing, snowboarding, rock-climbing and, a new sport for the WSEC, ice hockey, which garnered a thumbs up from everyone.</p>

                        <p><strong>CONGRATULATIONS</strong> to athletes, C-Jay Martin and Mason Carlow, who earned first place in their alpine ski/snowboard events and Courtney Skillin, who came away with 4th place in the 2-Trac guided and unassisted event. It should be noted that the post-test results showed a 5-40% increase in athletes' knowledge and skills. As with all MOBALE camps, the athletes also gained valuable experience in life skills of self-help, orientation and mobility, and social interactions with adults and peers.</p>

                        <p><strong>THANK YOU</strong> to all the VOLUNTEERS who helped to organize, teach and supervise this event. SPECIAL THANKS go to WSEC coordinator, KIM STUMPH, who is stepping down after being at the helm for 3 years. Kim has the ability to be a strong and capable leader, while maintaining her composure and sense of humor.</p>

                        <h4>SUMMER IS ON THE HORIZON</h4>
                        <p>MOBALE staff work hard to get ready for 2019 SUMMER CAMP June 19-22 in Waterville, Maine. We are happy to announce that Camp Tracy and the Alfond Center will offer both outdoor and indoor sports from gymnastics, swimming, wrestling, archery, track and field, to name a few. Also returning for a second year will be a sport introduced last summer, a big hit with all the athletes, beep soccer. For more information about summer SEC or to REGISTER AN ATHLETE visit our website <strong>www.MOBALE.org</strong></p>

                        <h4>"V" IS FOR VALUABLE - Volunteers make MOBALE possible</h4>
                        <p>"If you enjoy sport, in combination with supporting and seeing young individuals grow, then simply jump in!" So says James Howard, Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor for the Maine Division for the Blind and Visually Impaired and rookie volunteer at the 2018 summer SEC. "I've played and coached soccer over 35 years and lessons learned on commitment to the team, technical learning and sportsmanship are life's building blocks. As a rehab professional, the benefits of participating in sports are vital." In his profession, James encounters visually impaired individuals seeking gainful employment. With unemployment for this population over 50%, James knows that the most successful clients are those who have foundational life and work skills, self-confidence and perseverance to take on the challenge of competing in the job market. James was impressed with MOBALE's program and when asked if he would consider volunteering again, he answered, "Absolutely! It was amazing to see so much growth in the athletes both technically and personally in such a short period of time."</p>

                        <h4>VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
                        <p>As a volunteer for the 2019 Summer SEC, you will make it possible to provide a valuable experience for blind and visually impaired athletes to learn and participate in sports in a way that is designed to address their unique needs. But that is only half the story – you will also gain a valuable experience in the satisfaction of seeing the growth and development of these young athletes. WE NEED YOU if you are a responsible adult, like sports, like kids and believe that all youth, no matter what disability they may have, deserve an opportunity to join in the fun and rewarding experiences that sport can offer.
