                    <p>Goalball was a huge hit at the 2024 camp! Athletes learned the fundamentals of this Paralympic team sport, from defensive positioning to accurate throwing. The intensity and focus required for goalball helped athletes develop spatial awareness and quick reflexes.</p>

                    <h3>Wrestling</h3>
                    <p>Our wrestling program builds strength, technique, and confidence. Athletes worked with experienced coaches to learn proper form, practice moves, and participate in friendly matches. The one-on-one nature of wrestling, combined with constant physical contact, makes it an ideal sport for visually impaired athletes.</p>

                    <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
                    <p>Rock climbing challenged our athletes both physically and mentally. With verbal route descriptions and hands-on exploration of the wall, athletes problem-solved their way to the top. The trust built between climbers and belayers was a powerful part of the experience.</p>

                    <h3>Tandem Biking</h3>
                    <p>Tandem biking gave athletes the thrill of cycling through scenic routes. Paired with experienced pilots (front riders), athletes pedaled together and enjoyed the freedom and speed of biking. The teamwork and communication required made tandem biking a favorite activity.</p>
