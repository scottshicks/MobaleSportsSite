                            <p>Tim has been involved with the sports camp since 2003. He started as an athlete at the age of eight and continued until he aged out in 2013, then continued to volunteer in 2014 and 2015. One of his favorite things about this camp is that he was able to join his high school wrestling team because he learned how to adapt the sport for the blind and visually impaired. Now that he has come back as a Board member, he is proud to pass on his experiences and show campers that no matter your ability, you can do anything that you put your mind to.</p>

Hanna&rsquo;s family loves to be outside exploring whenever they can. Her daughter has always enjoyed playing sports; however, with the consistent decrease in her vision it was extremely difficult to navigate keeping her in sports. MOBALE has lifted her daughter&rsquo;s confidence, taught her new ways to adapt, and built friendships with others who are navigating similar challenges. Hanna is so thankful for this camp and looks forward to the years to come!</p>
