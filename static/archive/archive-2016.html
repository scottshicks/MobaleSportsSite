                    <p>The Paralympic Games are taking place in Brazil! One of the sports featured is goalball, a team sport designed specifically for blind and visually-impaired athletes.</p>
                    <p>Goalball is played by two teams of three players with a ball that has bells inside. Players wear eyeshades to ensure fair play, and they must use their hearing to track the ball and defend their goal while trying to score on their opponents.</p>
                    <p>This exciting sport requires teamwork, quick reflexes, and excellent spatial awareness. It's one of the sports we introduce to athletes at MOBALE camps!</p>

                <h2>Got P.E.?</h2>
                <time datetime="2016-02-29">February 29, 2016</time>

                    <p>MOBALE recognizes that students with visual impairments often face barriers to participating in physical education classes. We're here to help!</p>

                    <h3>Breaking Down Barriers in Physical Education</h3>
                    <p>Physical education is a vital part of every student's education, promoting health, wellness, fitness, and social development. However, traditional P.E. classes may not always be accessible to students who are blind or visually impaired.</p>

                    <h3>How MOBALE Can Help</h3>
                    <p>We work with students, families, teachers, and schools to create inclusive physical education experiences. Our support includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consultation on adaptive sports techniques</li>
                        <li>Recommendations for accessible equipment</li>
                        <li>Training for P.E. teachers on visual impairment accommodations</li>
                        <li>Resources for adapted physical activities</li>
                        <li>Advocacy for inclusive recreation opportunities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>For Students and Families</h3>
                    <p>If you're a student with a visual impairment who wants to participate more fully in P.E., or a parent advocating for your child's access to physical education, MOBALE can provide guidance and support.</p>

                    <h3>For Educators</h3>
                    <p>Physical education teachers and administrators who want to learn how to better serve students with visual impairments are welcome to reach out. We can provide resources, training, and practical strategies for creating an inclusive P.E. environment.</p>

                    <h3>Reach Out!</h3>
                    <p>For more information about physical education access and wellness training for students with visual impairments, contact:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Michelle Mason:</strong> valhallatrailhead@gmail.com</li>
                        <li><strong>Aisha Hixon:</strong> aisha.hixon@yahoo.com</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Don't let barriers stand in the way of physical activity and wellness. Together, we can ensure all students have the opportunity to participate in meaningful physical education experiences.</p>
